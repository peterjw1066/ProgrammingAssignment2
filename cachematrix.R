## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix object.
## cacheSolve takes the cached mtrix creaed by makeCacheMatrix and computes it's inverse.

## Creates a matrix object that can cache it's inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
